# gesh

gesh is a shell I'm developing to learn Rust, system-level concepts, and anything else along the way. It's
a toy project that currently isn't meant to be taken seriously.

## Usage

Clone this project and execute
```
cargo run gesh
```

## Contribute

Since this is a learning project, I won't be accepting contributions at the moment.
